Yesh
 Something. Yesh is the first “something” that emerged from the ayin, or nothingness, before creation.

 Zohar means “The Book of Radiance” and refers to the Kabbalah’s five main books. Most of the Zohar is written from the point of view of Simeon ben Yohai, a famous rabbi of the second century and the book’s supposed creator. The Zohar consists of stories of Simeon ben Yohai wandering through the desert of Galilee, commenting on the Torah and exchanging kabbalistic wisdom with his companions and followers. The Zohar has been translated into English in a twenty-two-volume set.
