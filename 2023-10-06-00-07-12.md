Binah
 Binah means “understanding” and represents structure and femininity. In the stages of creation, Binah comes after Chochmah, when specific thoughts and ideas begin to exist. Binah, as the first female presence, is also considered the mother of other sefirot. Binah represents the left hemisphere of God’s brain and lies on the left (feminine) side of the Tree of Life.
C.E.
