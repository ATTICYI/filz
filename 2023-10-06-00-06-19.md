Aramaic
 Aramaic is a Semitic language that’s no longer spoken. The term “Semitic” refers to the people and languages of the Middle East, namely North Africa and Southwestern Asia, though the common term “anti-Semitic” has come to mean “anti-Jewish.” Aramaic served as a common language for people of the Middle East and was at one point the primary language of Jews. Both the Talmud and the Zohar were first written in Aramaic.
